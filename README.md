# AI Dev Learning Hub

This repository centralizes **learning resources, code examples and hands-on materials**
used in **AI Engineering / Data / Cloud** trainings for developers.

It is designed as a **progressive learning hub**, covering the full lifecycle of
Machine Learning systems: from modeling to deployment and production concerns.

## Repository structure

### 🧠 Machine-Learning
Resources and code samples related to **classical Machine Learning**, including:

- data preparation and feature engineering  
- supervised / unsupervised learning  
- model evaluation and validation  
- practical ML use cases in Python  

This folder supports the **Machine Learning fundamentals** part of the training.

---

### 🤖 Deep-Learning
Materials focused on **Deep Learning and advanced AI concepts**, such as:

- neural networks foundations  
- deep learning architectures  
- applied AI use cases  
- experimentation and model iteration  

This section complements the ML part with more **advanced modeling techniques**.

---

### 🚀 MLOps
Resources related to **deployment, automation and productionization of AI systems**, including:

- API development for ML models (FastAPI, Streamlit, etc.)  
- containerization and deployment workflows  
- CI/CD concepts for AI projects  
- cloud-oriented practices and automation  

This folder supports the **engineering and operational side of AI systems**.

## 🗄️ Legacy content

The `MLOps/legacy/` directory contains **archived materials** imported from older repositories.

These contents are kept for:
- backup purposes  
- historical reference  
- transition toward cleaner and updated modules  

> ⚠️ Legacy content is **not actively maintained** and may be progressively refactored,
replaced or removed as the training materials evolve.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is intended for **educational and training purposes**.
It does not aim to provide production-ready code, but rather:
- clear learning examples  
- structured progression  
- practical insights into AI engineering

---

## 📌 Notes

- Content may evolve over time as trainings are updated  
- New modules may progressively replace legacy materials  
- The structure reflects real-world AI engineering workflows
